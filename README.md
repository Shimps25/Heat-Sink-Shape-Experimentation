# 🧊 Heat Sink Design Variations — Experimental CAD Project

This project explores a series of custom-designed heat sinks, all based on a fixed 40×40 mm footprint. The objective was to analyze and visualize how different fin geometries affect surface area exposure, thermal dissipation potential, and structural manufacturability.

---

## 🔧 Project Goal

To explore, design, and compare **multiple heat sink geometries** for the same base dimensions using CAD (Fusion 360). These models are optimized for:

- 🔺 Improved airflow
- 📐 Maximized surface area
- 🖨️ 3D printability and manufacturability
- 🧱 Structural simplicity vs. complexity balance

---

## 📐 Design Parameters

- **Base dimensions**: 40 mm × 40 mm (constant)
- **Material assumed**: Aluminum (for thermal conductivity reference)
- **Design constraints**:
  - Passive cooling only (no fans)
  - Fins ≥ 1 mm thick for 3D printability
  - Geometries suitable for vertical or horizontal airflow

## 🧩 Design Variants

### 1. 🔳 Concentric Pyramid Fin
A layered concentric square pattern rising toward the center — ideal for uniform heat spread and unique visual appeal.

### 2. 🟫 Linear Rectangular Fins
Traditional vertical fins with maximum parallel surface area — reliable for basic heat dissipation.
